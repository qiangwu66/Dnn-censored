# Inference for Censored Data with DNN

The simulations includes the finite sample performance of the proposed estimation procedure, the one-sample test, the two-sample test, and the goodness-of-fit test. The real data is about the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatment (SUPPORT), which is publicly available at https://biostat.app.vumc.org/wiki/Main/DataSets.

## Gaussian Quadrature

Gaussian quadrature is a numerical integration method used to compute definite integrals with high accuracy. It transforms the integral into a weighted sum by selecting appropriate integration points and weights.

---

### Basic Principle

The goal of Gaussian quadrature is to approximate the definite integral by carefully choosing specific points (called **Gaussian nodes**) in the integration interval and associated weights. The formula is:

$$
\int_a^b f(x) dx \approx \sum_{i=1}^n w_i f(x_i)
$$

Where:
- \(x_i\) are the **Gaussian nodes** within the integration interval.
- \(w_i\) are the weights corresponding to each node.
- \(n\) is the number of integration points (i.e., the number of Gaussian nodes).

One major advantage of Gaussian quadrature is that if the integrand \(f(x)\) is a polynomial \(P(x)\) of degree less than \(2n\), the integral is computed **exactly**.

---

### Steps of Gaussian Quadrature

#### 1. Standard Interval Quadrature
Gaussian quadrature is typically applied on the standard interval \([-1, 1]\). The formula for this case is:

$$
\int_{-1}^1 f(x) dx \approx \sum_{i=1}^n w_i f(x_i)
$$

#### 2. Transforming to a General Interval
For an arbitrary interval \([a, b]\), a variable substitution is performed to map the interval to \([-1, 1]\):

$$
x = \frac{b-a}{2} \xi + \frac{b+a}{2}, \quad dx = \frac{b-a}{2} d\xi
$$

The integral becomes:

$$
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = \frac{b-a}{2} \int_{-1}^1 f\left(\frac{b-a}{2} \xi + \frac{b+a}{2}\right) d\xi
$$

Then Gaussian quadrature can be applied on the transformed integral.

---
### Gaussian Nodes and Weights

The Gaussian nodes \(x_i\) are the roots of orthogonal polynomials (e.g., Legendre polynomials) on the interval \([-1, 1]\), while the weights \(w_i\) are computed as:

$$
w_i = \int_{-1}^1 \prod_{j \neq i} \frac{\xi - x_j}{x_i - x_j} d\xi,
$$

For various values of \(n\), the nodes and weights can be computed numerically or obtained from precomputed tables.

---

### Example Code

Below is an example implementation of Gaussian quadrature in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

def gaussian_quadrature(func, a, b, n):
    # Get Gaussian nodes and weights
    x, w = np.polynomial.legendre.leggauss(n)
    
    # Transform interval [a, b] to [-1, 1]
    t = 0.5 * (x + 1) * (b - a) + a
    transformed_weights = 0.5 * (b - a) * w
    
    # Compute the weighted sum
    integral = np.sum(transformed_weights * func(t))
    return integral

### Example: Compute âˆ«_0^1 (x^2) dx
result = gaussian_quadrature(lambda x: x**2, 0, 1, 3)
print(f"Integral result: {result}")
